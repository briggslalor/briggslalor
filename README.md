Driven and inquisitive finance graduate from Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. Currently working to expand my professional skill set through Columbia University’s FinTech Bootcamp. Upon completion, I am eager to enter the financial industries sector as a research or data analyst. 

Through Columbia University’s FinTech Bootcamp, I am gaining experience using and applying Python and its many libraries to a number of financial applications including quantitative data analysis and visualization, machine learning and algorithmic trading. I have utilized the following Python libraries, and more, to complete weekly challenges over the course of the bootcamp:

     pandas
     NumPy
     SciPy
     SQL
     hvPlot, HoloViews and Bokeh
     scikit-learn
     TensorFlow
     Keras

My weekly challenges can be viewed in the following Repository:

In addition to the weekly challenges, I worked to complete 3 capstone projects following each of the major modules within the Bootcamp course: Financial Programming with Python, Machine Learning Applications in Finance, and Blockchain technologies. These three projects can be viewed in the following repository:

Additionally, I am currently learning to use Solidity to interact with and deploy Smart Contracts onto the Ethereum blockchain. I am gaining experience making Wallets, building and deploying transactions contracts and creating and deploying my own fungible and non-fungible tokens to the chain.
